## 🚀 Quick Start: 3-Step Pipeline

Follow this **end-to-end pipeline** to run model inference, perform cell retrieval, and evaluate performance using the **PBMC-Ding** dataset as an example.

---

### **Step 1: Model Inference**  
Generate cell embeddings from raw single-cell data using pre-trained models.

#### Example: Geneformer
```bash
cd model_inference/geneformer
# Ensure paths are set: model weights, input .h5ad, output embedding path
bash run_model.sh
```

#### Example: cellfishing.jl (Julia)
> Requires **Julia 1.6.7** (download the zip installer if needed)
```bash
cd model_inference/cellfishing
julia run_cellfishing.jl
```

> Output: `.npy` files with cell embeddings saved in specified directories.

---

### **Step 2: Cell Retrieval**  
Query cells using the generated embeddings and reference annotations.

#### Example: PBMC-Ding Retrieval
```bash
cd scripts
# Update embedding and .h5ad paths if needed
bash PBMC-Ding_retrieval.sh
```

> Output: Retrieval results (e.g., Indexes and similarity scores of retrieved single cells) for query cells.

---

### **Step 3: Performance Evaluation**  
Compute retrieval metrics (e.g., Retrieval Accuracy, Retrieval Diversity and Retrieval Fairness).

#### Example: Evaluate PBMC-Ding
```bash
cd scripts
bash run_metric.sh
```

> Output: Summary of retrieval performance across cell types and conditions.
