## Downstream analysis: Marker genes analysis

### Code
We perform marker genes analysis on two perspectives, one is consistency and another is detection accuracy. For the marker gene detection consistency, please run [Panel_benchmark_marker_consistency/run_all.sh](Panel_benchmark_marker_consistency/run_all.sh). For the marker genes detection accuracy, you could run [Panel_benchmark_marker_detection_accuracy/run_all.sh](Panel_benchmark_marker_detection_accuracy/run_all.sh). [Panel_benchmark_marker_detection_accuracy/DE_genes_plots.ipynb](Panel_benchmark_marker_detection_accuracy/DE_genes_plots.ipynb) provides the notebook for further analysis and visualization.

### Required data
To run the code we stated previously, you need to download the required output results first (from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10vaR2C0SKWZztVkGlQPF5MqEEpWwBmSq?usp=drive_link)), which are generated from benchmark experiments.
