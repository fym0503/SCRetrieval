## Downstream analysis: novel cell detection

We investigate the performance of different methods on novel cell detection quantitatively. As shown in folder [Panel_quantitative_benchmark](Panel_quantitative_benchmark), the code files used for analysis are summarized for each dataset, respectively. Please run the `run_precision_score.sh` in each folder to calculate metrics firstly, and run notebook [novelcell_plots.ipynb](novelcell_plots.ipynb) for visualization.

The code for statistical test and visualization are listed in folder [Panel_statistical_testing](Panel_statistical_testing). 

The required data for analysis and visualization can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10vaR2C0SKWZztVkGlQPF5MqEEpWwBmSq?usp=drive_link).
