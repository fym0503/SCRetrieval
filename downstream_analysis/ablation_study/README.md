## Analysis of different hyperparameters

To test the influence of different hyperparameters of retrieval process using Faiss (n_centroids and n_probe), we run experiments on SCimilarity and show the analysis code here. The summarized result is shown in [scimilarity_metrics_abl.csv](scimilarity_metrics_abl.csv). [ablation_study.py](ablation_study.py) and [umap_and_abl.ipynb](umap_and_abl.ipynb) are used for visualization. 

The required data for analysis and visualization can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10vaR2C0SKWZztVkGlQPF5MqEEpWwBmSq?usp=drive_link).
